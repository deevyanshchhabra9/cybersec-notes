Ports : r the adrreses where we send packerts // take it as example of reciervers adress

eg : zoom is a software it developers fix its port in its code and by default our pc sets the fixed port suppose 8080 for recieving packets from zoom

Well-Known Ports (0-1023):

These ports are used by widely used protocols and services. For example:
Port 80 for HTTP (web traffic)
Port 443 for HTTPS (secure web traffic)
Port 22 for SSH (secure shell)
Registered Ports (1024-49151):

These ports are assigned for specific applications by software vendors. They are less commonly used than well-known ports but are still standardized for various services. For example:
Port 3306 for MySQL database
Port 5432 for PostgreSQL database
Port 8080 for HTTP alternate (commonly used for web services and development)
Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535):

These ports are used for temporary or private connections, often assigned dynamically by applications. They are generally used for ephemeral ports in client-side connections or internal services. For example:
Port 50000 might be used for custom applications or services in a private network
Ports in this range are often used for short-lived connections or client-side applications that need unique, temporary endpoints


// PROTOCOLS
:  RULES AND REGULATION OF NETWORKING
-> set of rules how data is transmitted
-> 1. Application layer has some protocols like Telnet,Http,SNTP

-> 2.Transport layer has protocols like TCP,UDP

-> 3. Internet : IP,ICMP,ARP,DHCP

-> 4. Netwok acess : Ethernet , PPP,ADSL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> TCP(Transmission control Protocol) 
1. TCP HAS 6 FLAGS WHICH HELP IN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION OF TCP

-> URG(urgent) : if packet is really important user would atach urg flag to it as this reffrs this packet needs to be processed on urgent basis .. just help in priortizing task

-> FIN(finish) : there will be no further transmission  .. connection needs to break when data transmission is complete

-> RST(reset) : resets a connection . if networking as error we just reset connection

-> PSH(push) : sends all buffered data immidiately .. if a user wants to break connection and it is duty of psh to make him altert and sends left data

-> Acknowledgement : acknowledges the recipt of pakets.  double tick in whatsapp means message is recieved by user

-> SYN(synchronize) : initiates a connection bw hosts. to establish connection bw two user first flag is SYN TO Initiate connection

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHEK OUT IMAGE : 3WAYHS
// there is also a pt when we send syn flag to ser b port that should be open to establish a connection

TCP 3 WAY HS : USER A AND USER B
1. SYN FLAG BY USER A TO B < TO INITIATE CONNECTION>
2. USER B SEND SYN + ACK THAT RECIEVED USER A FLAG AND AGAIN IT SEND SIN AS B ALSO WANTS TO ESTABLISH CONNECTION WITH A
3. THEN USER A AGAIN SEND ACK TO B THAT YES UR SYN + ACK IS REACHED TO ME

-> this 3 step process is known as 3 way handshake
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCP CONNECTION TERMINATION USER A AND B

1. USER A SENDS FIN FLAG TO B TO BREAK CONNECTION
2. USER B SEND ACK TO A
3. AGASIN USER B TOOK SOMETIME TO CHECK ALL DATA IS TRASMITTED AND IF YES THEN USER B AGAIN SENDS FIN FLAG TO USER A	
4. TEHN USER A AGAIN SENDS ACK TO B

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UDP(user datagram protocol) : udp is fast but less secure
1.Request by a
2. response by b and data sharing starts

// all thse protocols in smtp,dns take use of tcp and dns take use of both tcp and udp to establish connection
